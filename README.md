# Baseball Analysis

We have created an analytical report (using jupyter notebook) and presentation on baseball statistics from 1871 to 2010. Our aim was to investigate the importance of offensive and defensive strategies with respect to the number of games won in baseball. 

Our analytical objectives are the following: 
1. Key offensive statistics that significantly affect the number of games won
2. The impact of defensive factors on team performance and the likelihood of winning
3. The effectiveness of different strategies across specific time periods
4. Trends and patterns in the data for informed decision-making

Through these analyses, we aim to provide valuable insights to baseball teams, coaches, and decision-makers, helping them to allocate resources effectively, optimize their strategies, and increase their chances of winning games.
