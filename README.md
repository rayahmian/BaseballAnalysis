# Baseball Analysis

## Overview
This project is an analytical report and presentation on baseball statistics from the years 1871 to 2010. The main objective is to investigate the impact of offensive and defensive strategies on the number of games won in baseball. The analysis aims to provide valuable insights to baseball teams, coaches, and decision-makers to optimize their strategies and improve their chances of winning games.

The analytical objectives are to investigate: 
1. Key offensive statistics that significantly affect the number of games won
2. The impact of defensive factors on team performance and the likelihood of winning
3. The effectiveness of different strategies across specific time periods
4. Trends and patterns in the data for informed decision-making

## Conclusions
The project identified key findings through regression analysis and model evaluations. Notably, the balanced strategy model demonstrated the highest R^2 statistics in various time periods, indicating its effectiveness in predicting games won. Offensive and defensive strategies also showed significance in different time frames.

## Trends and Recommendations
Trends were identified in offensive and defensive statistics, offering teams valuable insights for strategic decision-making. Teams and coaches can focus on improving offensive strategies like Runs Scored, Hits, and Home Runs, along with defensive aspects like Shutout, Infield Put Outs, and Saves to boost their performance.

## Model Performance
The balanced strategy model outperformed the offensive and defensive models with the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values. This indicates its superior accuracy in predicting future games compared to other models.

## Dataset and Analysis
The project utilized a structured dataset containing baseball team statistics. Analytical insights were derived using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The presentation highlights key findings and visualizations to aid data-driven decision-making.
